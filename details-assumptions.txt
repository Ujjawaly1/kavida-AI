Assumptions About Excel Structure

1. The Excel shipping report follows a consistent structure with clearly labeled columns.
2. The PO NUMBER in the shipping report corresponds to the PO numbers in the current PO data, possibly with a prefix (e.g., "KAVI322693" corresponds to "SM322693").
3. The PART NUMBER in the shipping report directly matches the part numbers in the current PO data.
4. The PO LINE ITEM in the shipping report corresponds to the Line number in the current PO data.
5. Each row in the shipping report represents a single shipment for a specific part.
6. Multiple rows with the same part number indicate multiple shipments of the same item.
7. The QTY column represents the quantity shipped in that particular shipment.
8. The DATE column represents the shipment date.
9. The TRACKING NUMBER uniquely identifies each shipment.
